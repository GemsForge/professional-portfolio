# Aura Logbook

Aura Logbook is a mood-tracking and reflective-journaling application with a .NET 9 / ASP.NET Core API and a separate React, TypeScript, and Vite UI. Development and FIT/Staging use SQLite through Dapper with versioned startup migrations. The committed JSON files are retained as import and local-development seed sources rather than the active Development data store.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [Node.js 20 or newer](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- Git

## First-time setup

From the repository root:

```bash
dotnet restore AuraLogbook.sln
npm ci --prefix aura-ui
```

The API project has a .NET user-secrets ID (`AuraLogbook.Api`). Configure a private JWT signing key for local development before registering/logging in:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets --project AuraLogbook.Api/AuraLogbook.Api.csproj set "Jwt:Key" "<your-random-secret>"
```

Use a private random value of at least 32 bytes. Do not commit secrets or paste them into frontend configuration. `Jwt:Issuer` and `Jwt:Audience` default to the values in `AuraLogbook.Api/appsettings.json`.

## Run API and UI together

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the API and UI together, prefixes their output with `[API]` and `[UI]`, and stops the sibling service if one exits or fails to start. Press **Ctrl+C** once to stop both services.

| Service | Local URL |
| --- | --- |
| UI | [http://localhost:58407](http://localhost:58407) |
| API base | [http://localhost:5082/api](http://localhost:5082/api) |
| Swagger (Development only) | [http://localhost:5082/swagger](http://localhost:5082/swagger) |

The launcher keeps the local API listener and the UI's API target aligned. By default, both the listener and that target use API port `5082`; the UI itself uses port `58407`. When `aura-ui/.env.local` or an exported `VITE_API_BASE_URL` points to a local HTTP API, the launcher uses that URL's port for the API listener too. An explicit `AURA_API_PORT` must match a local `VITE_API_BASE_URL`; conflicting values stop startup with instructions to align them. The `.env.local` file is ignored by Git and is used normally when running Vite by itself.

### Preview the web UI on a phone

The responsive React web UI can be previewed in a phone browser over the same Wi-Fi network. This is a web preview; it does not require React Native or Expo. Start the API with the combined launcher above and leave it running. In a second terminal, start a network-accessible Vite server from `aura-ui/`:

```bash
cd aura-ui
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 58413 --strictPort
```

Open `http://<laptop-LAN-IP>:58413` on the phone, replacing `<laptop-LAN-IP>` with the laptop's local network address. The phone and laptop must be on the same network, and that network must allow devices to communicate with each other. Add a web route to preview, such as `/login`; use an existing account to inspect protected pages.

Vite's `/api` proxy forwards browser requests to the API at `http://127.0.0.1:5082`, so the API can remain bound to the laptop. The proxy is configured in `aura-ui/vite.config.ts`. `VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api` makes the browser use that same-origin proxy. The `--host 0.0.0.0` option makes the development UI reachable from other devices on the local network; use this only on a trusted network and stop the preview with **Ctrl+C** when finished. This is a development server, not a public or production deployment.

To use different local ports, set `AURA_API_PORT` and/or `AURA_UI_PORT` before starting the launcher. For example, set `AURA_API_PORT=5124` and `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5124/api` together. If any requested API port is occupied, including the default, the launcher stops with the exact port and recovery options so OAuth callbacks cannot reach a different API instance. When changing ports, update the Spotify redirect URI in both API configuration and Spotify's app settings; the launcher never kills unrelated listeners. A `VITE_API_BASE_URL` that points to a remote host continues to be a UI-only override.

## Run each service separately

API, from `AuraLogbook.Api/`:

```bash
dotnet run --launch-profile http
```

## Start the Expo mobile shell

The Expo and React Native mobile shell is in `aura-mobile/`. Install its dependencies once and start Expo:

```bash
cd aura-mobile
npm install
npm run start
```

Open the project in Expo Go or a simulator. The shell currently provides native Today, Log, Journal, and Profile destinations with the Aura visual foundation. Authenticated API data and mood entry are intentionally pending mobile API hosting and auth-contract readiness; the mobile shell does not use the Mac's localhost API from a physical device. See the [mobile shell guide](docs/ux/mobile-shell.md).

## Runtime environments

Aura Logbook uses these environment aliases:

| Alias | ASP.NET Core environment | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DEV` | `Development` | Local development database and JSON user seeding |
| `FIT` | `Staging` | Feature/integration testing with isolated staging data |
| `PRO` | `Production` | Production configuration; startup seeding disabled |

Run the API with an alias by setting `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`:

```bash
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development dotnet run --project AuraLogbook.Api
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Staging dotnet run --project AuraLogbook.Api
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production dotnet run --project AuraLogbook.Api
```

For the combined API and UI launcher, use `AURA_ENV`:

```bash
AURA_ENV=DEV npm run dev
AURA_ENV=FIT npm run dev
AURA_ENV=PRO npm run dev
```

The API logs the resolved ASP.NET Core environment and whether startup user
seeding is enabled. `appsettings.json` loads first, followed by the matching
environment file; later environment variables and command-line settings can
override both.

See [Runtime environments](docs/runtime-environments.md) for the complete
configuration and database seeding guide.

## Relational database workflow

The Development and FIT/Staging environments use SQLite with versioned SQL
migrations. The API applies pending migrations at startup and records them in
`__SchemaMigrations`. To import the complete active JSON dataset into a clean
development database, use the [database seeder](https://github.com/GemsForge/aura-logbook-api/blob/3a93ed206364f1d856cc675227da009e24a5cfcb/Scripts/DatabaseSeeder/README.md).

The seeder writes a reconciliation report containing source and stored counts.
Keep the JSON files unchanged as the migration and audit source; the relational
database is the runtime source for Development and FIT/Staging.

For FIT/Staging diagnostics, use `GET /health/database`. To deliberately reset
only the staging database, run `AURA_ENV=FIT node Scripts/reset-staging-db.mjs
--confirm`; the script refuses ambiguous environment or confirmation settings.

UI, from `aura-ui/` (run `npm ci` there first):

```bash
npm run dev
```

For standalone UI development, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5082/api` in `aura-ui/.env.local`. Vite is configured for port 58407 with strict-port behavior.

## Tests and build

Run API tests from the repository root:

```bash
dotnet test AuraLogbook.sln
```

Run UI checks from `aura-ui/`:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test:run
npm run test:startup
npm run build
```

Before `test:run`, provide a valid `VITE_API_BASE_URL` through `aura-ui/.env.local` or the process environment; the API does not need to be running because the tests mock requests, but the client still constructs absolute request URLs.

The combined launcher orchestration tests run from the repository root:

```bash
node --test Scripts/dev.test.mjs
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Port already in use:** The launcher reports the exact port. For an automatically selected default, it moves to the next available API port and updates the UI target. For an explicit local API URL or `AURA_API_PORT`, stop the process using that port or choose another port and keep the settings aligned; the launcher never kills unrelated processes.
- **UI reports an API/network error:** Check that the API is running and that local `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and `AURA_API_PORT` use the same port. The combined launcher derives the API listener port from a local `VITE_API_BASE_URL`; if both settings are provided but conflict, correct one before restarting.
- **UI dependencies missing:** Run `npm ci` in `aura-ui/` (or `npm ci --prefix aura-ui` at the root).
- **JWT or authentication fails:** Ensure a private `Jwt:Key` is configured and that the token was issued by the current API configuration. `GET /api/Auth/me` and mood routes require a valid bearer token; register or log in again after changing the signing key.
- **Weather unavailable:** `GET /api/Weather/current` uses Open-Meteo geocoding and forecast endpoints. No API key is needed for local development. Check API logs and provider connectivity; see [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md) for service terms and attribution.

Manual smoke test: run `npm run dev`, open the UI and Swagger URLs above, verify the UI reaches the local API, then press Ctrl+C and confirm both services stop.
