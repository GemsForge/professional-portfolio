# Pathway-aware mood-combination reflections

Aura Logbook can show an optional, authored reflection when a signed-in user selects two or three distinct moods. The reflection is selected by the exact mood set and the user’s chosen spiritual pathway. It is not a diagnosis, score, or replacement for the user’s own journal entry.

## Data and import

Curated source records live in `aura-ui/data/aura_logbook_mood_combinations.json`. Each record has a stable ID, two or three distinct mood names, and one non-empty interpretation for each supported pathway. The importer rejects duplicate IDs, duplicate mood sets, unknown moods, and incomplete pathway records. Mood order is normalized when the key is stored.

Migration `018_mood_combination_interpretations.sql` creates the lookup table and index. The normal DatabaseSeeder run applies pending migrations and imports the configured combinations source. For a local Development database, from the repository root:

```bash
dotnet run --project Scripts/DatabaseSeeder/DatabaseSeeder.csproj -- \
  --database AuraLogbook.Api/Data/auralogbook-dev.db \
  --combinations aura-ui/data/aura_logbook_mood_combinations.json
```

The seeder also imports the user, mood, and zodiac JSON sources using its documented defaults. Use a disposable local database when checking import behavior.

## API

`GET /api/mood-combinations/interpretation` requires a bearer token and accepts:

| Query parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `moods` | Two or three comma-separated, distinct mood names. Order does not affect the match. |
| `pathwayKey` | The stored pathway enum: `0` Mindfulness, `1` Energy, or `2` Faith. |

The endpoint returns the authored interpretation or `204 No Content` when the combination has no matching record. Invalid pathway, mood, or count values return `400 Bad Request`.

## UI behavior

The mood-entry form requests a reflection only when two or three moods are selected and a user is signed in. While data loads it shows a status message. Missing content is explained, and request errors offer a retry. Logging remains available if the endpoint fails. The panel uses the current primary theme surface and border tokens; user-authored reflection text remains independent.
